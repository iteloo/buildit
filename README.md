build.It is an interactive playground where students can freely explore fundamental concepts in computer science, such as types, variables, control/loops, recursion, etc, by dragging-and-dropping basic building blocks to construct interesting programs.

It is built using Javascript and Elm :), and runs on all modern web browsers.

## Technical Note

The type system implemented is Hindley-Milner. I.e. it supports top-level type variables.
